        <p style="color: white;">Obito Uchiha is a central antagonist of the Naruto franchise.He was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he entrusted to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara Uchiha, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with the world, and he sought to replace it with a new one.</p><br>

        <p style="color: white;">Using the aliases of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha, Obito manipulated the Akatsuki from the shadows to further his plans, eventually going public with them and in the process starting the Fourth Shinobi World War. He nonetheless killed Konan to transplant the Rinnegan from Nagato's corpse into his missing left eye. After he fought against Kakashi to remove the Forbidden Curse Tag that Madara placed inside his heart, he became the Ten Tails' Jinchuuriki</p><br>

        <p  style="color: gold;"  ><Font face="algerian"><Font size="5">"In the ninja world those who break the rules and laws are regarded as scum, but those who would abandon even one of their friends are even worse than scum. I'm scum anyway, so I’m going to choose to break the rules. If doing that somehow makes me less than a true shinobi, then I’ll just go and crush all of the so-called real shinobi.”</Font></p>
