        <h4 class="heading"><em><u>Introduction</u></em></h4>
        <p style="color:#AAF200">In 1997, Masashi Kishimoto created the first published incarnation of the Naruto series. Debuting in Akamaru Jump, the Naruto one-shot <br>would be Kishimoto's first incarnation of the Naruto universe. Though the plot of the one-shot bears little resemblance to the later shōnen manga, <br>many of the same character and ninja themes would be displayed for the first time.<br>

        <br>
        <h4 class="heading"><em><u>Growth and Popularity</u></em></h4>
            <p style="color:#AAF200">The series' length and popularity is comparable to that of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Toriyama">Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball</a></u>, another popular action/martial arts-oriented <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga">shōnen</a></u> manga, and one that was said to have greatly <br>influenced Kishimoto's manga, Naruto. Since its creation, Naruto has spawned a large number of fansites that contain detailed information, guides, and active forums. Some of the first and most <br>popular sites targeted at English speaking audiences were established shortly after the first English manga volume was released in August of 2003. Also, like many other manga and anime titles, <br>Naruto has also spawned its own <u>collectible card game</u>, along with an array of merchandise, such as action figures, clothing, stationery kits and household goods.</p>

        <p style="color:#AAF200"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/UkxNWd751S4AAAAC/kurama-naruto.gif" align="right" height="200" width="200">A long years ago,People lived in Konoha village was attacked by a demon,<u>Nine-Tailed Demon Fox</u>. The Fourth Hokage sacrifies his life to save the village by sealing the <u>Demon</u> inside his new born son named <u>Naruto Uzumaki</u>.Naruto maintains a balance between drama and comedy, with plenty of action interspersed. It follows Naruto and his friends' personal growth and development as ninja, and emphasises their interactions with each other and the influence of their backgrounds on their personalities. Naruto finds two friends and comrades in <u>Sasuke Uchiha</u> and <u>Sakura Haruno</u>, two fellow young ninja who are assigned with him to form a three-person team under a very experienced sensei named <u>Kakashi Hatake</u>. Naruto also confides in other characters as well that he has met through the Chūnin Exam. They learn new abilities, get to know each other and other villagers better, and experience a coming-of-age journey as Naruto dreams of becoming the <u><em>Hokage</em></u> of Konoha.<br>
            Several major villains came into play as well, the first being <u><em>Zabuza Momochi</em></u>, a missing-nin from the Kirigakure, and his partner, <u>Haku</u>. Later, in the Chūnin Exam Arc, <u><b>Orochimaru</b></u> is introduced as an S-Class missing-nin at the top of Konoha's most wanted list, along with other Otogakure ninja, including <u><em>Kabuto Yakushi</em></u>, Team Dosu and the Sound Four.

When Sasuke was a little boy, he saw his older brother kill their parents. Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke’s older brother, told Sasuke that he also killed all of the other clan members to see if he was a strong ninja but that he will save Sasuke’s life because it was not even worth killing. From then on, Sasuke lived a lonely life full of hatred and destined to walk a path of an “Avatar of Revenge” and kill his brother. However, these feelings seemed to be alleviated when he befriended Naruto Uzumaki after graduating Ninja Academy. As they were working together in a team as “Genin" (which means rookie ninja), Naruto showed him what friendship and companionship were.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details  <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

Formerly the heiress of the Hyūga clan, she lost the position upon being deemed unsuited for the responsibilities of leading the clan. Nonetheless, Hinata persevered and from her observation of Naruto Uzumaki especially, Hinata found an example to follow. Through her membership with Team 8, she sought to become strong enough to change herself, if even a little at a time. A few years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata joined the Uzumaki clan after marrying Naruto.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinata_Hyuga"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

                <p style="margin:20px; color:rgb(176, 83, 139)">Jiraya was one of Konohagakure's Sannin. Famed as a hermit and pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in search of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote, and, posthumously, the world in its entirety – knowledge that would be passed on to his godson and final student, Naruto Uzumaki.Minato - selected as Konoha's Fourth Hokage after Jiraiya refused the position[19] - enjoyed the book, finding the main character very much like Jiraiya. He decided to name his and Kushina Uzumaki's then-unborn son "Naruto" after the main character, hoping that their Naruto would be just as determined as the character (and thus its author). Jiraiya tried to convince them not to since that would make him Naruto's godfather, but Minato and Kushina insisted this was a good thing.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiraiya_(Naruto)"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

She is famed as the world's strongest kunoichi and its greatest medical-nin. The repeated loss of her loved ones caused Tsunade to later abandon the life of a shinobi for many years. She is eventually persuaded to return to Konoha and take on the mantle of Fifth Hokage (五代目火影, Godaime Hokage, literally meaning: Fifth Fire Shadow), where her skills prove invaluable to the village.Tsunade is the granddaughter of Hashirama Senju and Mito Uzumaki. Because Hashirama was the First Hokage of Konohagakure, Tsunade is called "Princess".<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunade"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

After marrying Shikamaru Nara, she becomes a member of the Nara clan and emigrates to Konohagakure, where she works as a kunoichi for the village.Temari was born the eldest child of Karura and the Fourth Kazekage: Rasa. While it was customary for close relations to a Kage to be a jinchūriki, neither she nor her younger brother Kankurō were compatible with the One-Tail, so Gaara was chosen.Temari frequently appears alongside Shikamaru Nara. Though they were opponents during the Chūnin Exams, they came to each others' aid at different points in Part I. Despite her usual tough demeanour, she has a tendency to show a softer nature around Shikamaru, such as showing sympathy for him after his father scolded him for questioning if he should be a ninja after the Sasuke Uchiha rescue mission failed.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temari"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

However, after training under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes recognised as one of the greatest medical-nin in the world.Sakura is the only child of Kizashi and Mebuki Haruno. She had an healthy childhood, raised by her parents without any serious tragedy or complications, unlike her team members. When she entered Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls in her class started picking on her because of her broad forehead. Sakura tried to combat their teasing by hiding her forehead with her bangs, but this caused the girls to bully her even more. Ino Yamanaka, one of her classmates, saw this, and defended Sakura from her bullies and encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather than hide it.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakura_Haruno"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>

Unlike most shinobi, he lacked the skills necessary to use ninjutsu or genjutsu. However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training from Might Guy that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.Under Guy's leadership, Lee has acquired a number of his sensei's personality traits: he is energetic, optimistic, and hot-blooded, and shows the epitome of a "nice guy". He believes that one cannot dislike food and shows strong dedication to his promises; when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous training to prevent it from happening again. Lee speaks respectfully to others, never using contractions or swear words and always addressing people with appropriate honourifics (except his teammates, since Lee feels they are close enough to be spoken to informally). He also carries a small book and pencil to recall advice that Guy gives him over time.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Lee"><button style="background-color:#333333;color: #00FF00;">More Details <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-bounce"></i></button></a></p>
