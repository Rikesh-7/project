        <p style="color: white;">Madara Uchiha is one of the main antagonists of the Naruto franchise. He is the co-founder of the village of Konohagakure (the Village Hidden in the Leaves) and its first Rogue Ninja. Though thought to have died, Madara survived and planned to rule the Ninja World as a god, making Obito Uchiha into his apprentice. After Madara's actual death, Obito took his name and acted as his surrogate, carrying out his plans in his absence.</p><br>

        <p style="color: white;">He is eventually resurrected as an indestructible undead ninja and takes part in the Fourth Great Ninja War, during which he succeeds in his plan. He was thought to be the main antagonist in the series, due to manipulating Obito as a pawn and causing the Fourth Great Ninja War, but was later just another pawn when Kaguya ÅŒtsutsuki is revealed.</p><br>
